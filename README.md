# Credit-Card-Fraud-detection
This project uses Apache Spark and machine learning to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in imbalanced datasets. It handles class imbalance via oversampling and undersampling, trains models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, and evaluates them on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
